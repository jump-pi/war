# jump-pi war

The jump-pi/war repository defines a JEE example application that uses jump-pi/jar.  
All the dependencies are available in the jump-pi/jar repo, so Maven is not required. You just must include jumpi-jar (which is located at jump-pi/jar/build) into WEB-INF/lib, and also include all the .jar files located into jump-pi/jar/lib into the WEB-INF/lib.
